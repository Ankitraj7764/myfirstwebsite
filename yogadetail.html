        <p>A great Indian sage and yoga master, Sri Aurobindo says yoga is a methodical effort toward self-perfection
            through developing your talent potential on the physical, vital, mental, intellectual, and spiritual levels.
            And the most fundamental step you can take toward expanding the limits of your consciousness is to gain
            mastery over your mind.

            Therefore, yoga is an extraordinary spiritual science of self-development and self-realization that shows us
            how to develop our full potential in our many-sided lives. It was first devised by the rishis and sages of
            ancient India and has been maintained by a stream of living teachers ever since, who have continually
            adapted this science to every generation.

            Yogaâ€™s integrative approach brings deep harmony and unshakable balance to body and mind in order to awaken
            our latent capacity for a higher consciousness that is the true purpose of human evolution. The many methods
            of yoga spans a vast range from physical postures to breathing practices and meditation, all based upon a
            philosophy of consciousness and natural way of life</p>
        <p>Yoga for Back pain
